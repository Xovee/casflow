## Basic Usage

### Requirements

The code was tested with `python 3.7`, `tensorflow-gpu 2.0.0a`, `cudatookkit 10.0`, and `cudnn 7.6.5`. Install the dependencies via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/):

```shell
# create virtual environment
conda create --name casflow python=3.7 cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.6.5

# activate environment
conda activate casflow

# install other requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the code
```shell
cd casflow

# generate information cascades
python gene_cas.py

# generate cascade and global graph embeddings 
python gene_emb.py

# run the CasFlow model
python casflow.py
```
More running options are described in the codes, e.g., `--input=./dataset/weibo/`

### Run CasFlow online in browser

You can also run CasFlow model online in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19zQrAIo-yyfkH8m95UmdepzSryxHHs_a?usp=sharing) or [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/3470945/tree). Both of the two websites provide Python programming environment and GPU-support.
